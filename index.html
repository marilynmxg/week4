            <p>In essence, a supercharger is an air compressor that increases the pressure or density of air supplied to an internal combustion engine. This increase in air allows the engine to burn more fuel and thus produce more power.

            <h2>Aside</h2>
            <p>Superchargers come in various forms, but they all share the same fundamental principle: forced induction. Unlike turbochargers which are driven by exhaust gases, superchargers are typically belt-driven by the engine's crankshaft. This means that superchargers provide immediate power delivery, eliminating turbo lag and providing a more linear power curve.

            <h2>Div with one paragraph</h2>
            <p>One of the key advantages of superchargers is their ability to significantly boost engine power across the entire RPM range. This results in improved acceleration and throttle response, making the driving experience more exhilarating. Whether it's on the racetrack or the open road, supercharged vehicles command attention with their impressive performance capabilities.
